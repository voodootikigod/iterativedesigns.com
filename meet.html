<h2 class="title">Meet us in Person</h2>
<p>The value of face-to-face contact can never be underestimated and most especially not as part of the Iterative Designs process. We sponsor and participate in a wide variety of community based events and would love to meet you at them. Listed below are the upcoming and past events that we are involved with along with a brief description of what they do and why we are proud to be associated with them. </p>

		  <a href="http://www. barcampdc.org"><strong>BarCamp DC Fall 2008</strong></a>
<p>From their site, "BarCamp DC is an ad-hoc unconference and is part of the larger BarCamp movement. While there are topics suggested for discussion, there is no set agenda until everyone gathers. Attendees are required to participate to some degree: either by giving a presentation, demo, etc. or by facilitating a group discussion. Topics are flexible, as well."</p>

<p>We are once again happy to sponsor the BarCamp style movement in DC. We are looking forward to this exciting event and can't wait to see how it goes!</p>

		<div class="body">
		  <a href="http://www.rubydcamp.org"><strong>Ruby DCamp 2008</strong></a>
<p>From their site, "If you're experienced with Ruby then you know what you like about the language. But even more importantly you know what needs work! Here's your big chance! Gather with other experienced Rubyists, discuss what's broken, decide how to fix it, and then start down that path together."</p>

<p>We are quite excited about this event because we feel that it will bring some of the "weird" that we absolutely loved at <a href="http://www.rubyfringe.com">RubyFringe</a> to the DC area. We are sponsoring the event at the double secret gold status, which I think means that we are on the roll to go for Micheal Phelps 8 Gold Sponsorship next year -- or is that in four years. If you are in the area, definitely join us at this event, we are working very hard with <a href="http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/">Evan Light</a> to ensure that the event is stellar and you might even learn something (can't promise it though).</p>

		  <a href="http://www.rubynation.org"><strong>RubyNation 2008</strong></a>
<p>From their site, "RubyNation is an annual Ruby conference serving the Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, DC areas. This year's RubyNation will happen on August 1 and 2, 2008 in Herndon, VA."</p>
<p>This conference is seriously right in our backyard (and down the Toll Road), and we believe it is a great thing for the blossoming Ruby community in the Washington DC metro area. We have signed on as a sponsor of the event and hope to see you at the event.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO</strong> we will be hosting a party for the conference, more details to arrive closer to the date. Be on the look out because we will be bringing our standard beer geekery to a new level with this event. Hope to see you there!</p>

		  <p><b><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">Northern Virginia Languages Community </a></b></p>
<p>From the Kick Off Email spread to the wide variety of established User Groups in the area: "Thoughts on the makeup of the group include obtaining (however you want) a book, working through the book 1 chapter per week on one night of that week with a group of like minded individuals. For the first one, my company Iterative Designs will sponsor it (not sure what that means just yet) and we can go from there. It will mean meeting up and having a group to ask questions about the language we are learning and they aren’t going to give you the snub nose responses of “Don’t you know that — you n00b” that you might get in an IRC chat room."</p>
<p>For those of you who know us well, you will have already guessed that one of us wrote that email. Iterative Designs is trying to foster this community of learning and exploring within the programming domain within the Washington DC area. While User Groups are great (and we mean that), they are very focused on one platform or domain, we were thirsting for something broader and more exciting. We figured why not start a group and meet up.  Thus gave rise to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">Northern Virginia Languages Community</a>. We are trying to meet once a week in person to learn a new language; Erlang is going to be a first one so if you can join up and learn with us.</p>

<p>From their site, "RubyFringe is an avant-garde conference for developers that are excited about emerging Ruby projects and technologies. We're mounting a unique and eccentric gathering of the people and projects that are driving things forward in our community."</p>
<p>We were originally on the fence about going to RubyFringe mainly because there is already so much going on this year for our team. However, one inspirational blog comment later and within 5 minutes were were booking our tickets and gearing up to fly out to Toronto, ON Canada. This will be the first international trip for Iterative Designs and certainly not our last!</p>

We collaborate across disciplines for the benefit of cultural, charitable and scientific causes. We create, learn and teach as a group, inviting our neighbors around the block and around the world to join us!"</p>
<p>We are new, but very excited members of the HacDC organization and are extremely lucky to have such a great  community so easily accessible. We look forward to working with the entire HacDC group.</p>

<p>The Northern Virginia Ruby Users Group is one of the strongest and biggest Ruby user groups in the United States. Its members come together and share new ideas, thoughts, and general community about all things Ruby. The meetings are always a good time and we try to make it as often as we can. Its not uncommon to see a "superstar" or two at the meetings, so come on out and join the community, no Ruby knowledge required.</p>
